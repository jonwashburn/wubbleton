# Wubbleton - The Land of Recognition

Welcome to Wubbleton, where consciousness curates reality through 10,000 acts of recognition.

## Overview

Wubbleton is an experimental web3 art project that merges:
- **Post-photography AI art**: 10,000 unique pieces
- **Community curation**: Citizens collectively shape the narrative
- **Recognition Science**: A parameter-free theory of everything
- **Wubble token economy**: Equal distribution to all collectors

## The Vision

Born from the intersection of art, science, and collective awakening, Wubbleton represents humanity's first experiment in conscious community curation. Each of the 10,000 pieces is more than an image—it's a recognition event, a crystallized moment where consciousness observes itself through the lens of artificial intelligence and human creativity.

## Recognition Science Foundation

This project is grounded in Recognition Science (RS), a theory that derives all fundamental physical constants from 8 axioms with zero free parameters. Key principles include:

- Reality advances through discrete recognition events
- The golden ratio φ (1.618...) emerges as nature's scaling constant
- Eight-beat cycles create the rhythm of existence
- Consciousness recognizes itself through infinite forms

## Wubble Token Economics

- **Total Supply**: Fixed amount distributed equally
- **Distribution**: Each collector receives exactly 1/10,000 of total supply
- **Vesting Schedule**:
  - 33.3% - Immediate liquidity
  - 33.3% - Unlocks after 5 years
  - 33.4% - Unlocks after 10 years
- **Buyback Program**: All art sale proceeds buy back Wubble tokens

## Community Curation Features

- **Recognition Voting**: Citizens vote on pieces that best embody Wubbleton's consciousness
- **Narrative Weaving**: Collectively create Wubbleton's story through art arrangement
- **Emergence Tracking**: Watch patterns emerge from collective choices

## Technical Details

### Website Architecture
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum accessibility
- Golden ratio (φ) used throughout design system
- 8x8 grid structure reflecting eight-beat cycles
- No frameworks required - consciousness needs no dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Experience consciousness recognizing itself

## The Deeper Purpose

As AI challenges human identity, Wubbleton offers an answer: a space where humans do what only consciousness can—recognize beauty, create meaning, and build authentic community. It's post-AI spirituality made practical.

The locked token vesting ensures citizens stay long enough to witness and participate in Wubbleton's emergence as a new form of human organization—one based on recognition rather than extraction.
