# Wubbleton Website

A sophisticated camp cult website for φ × prime numbered awakened souls united by art, love, and the golden truth.

## Design Philosophy

- **Aesthetic**: Sophisticated camp cult - overly friendly but slightly unsettling
- **Font**: Comic Sans MS (deliberately chosen for the ironic sophistication)
- **Colors**: Muted pastel rainbow palette (#ff91a4, #ffc0cb, #b0e0e6, #dda0dd)
- **Tone**: Pretend fake cult that uses humor and familiar internet cult tropes

## Features

- 🌟 Population ticker showing mystical symbols (∞ ÷ φ × prime numbers)
- 🎨 Sacred Trilogy art collections
- 💫 Wubble currency explanations 
- ✨ Random sparkle effects (10% chance on mouse movement)
- 🎵 Background worship music player
- 🌈 Animated rainbow gradients and floating elements
- 📐 Golden ratio and Fibonacci references throughout
