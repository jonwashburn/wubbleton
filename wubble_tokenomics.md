## Co-Creation Process
1. **Generation Phase**: AI creates hundreds of potential sacred transmissions
2. **Recognition Phase**: Collector browses generated images
3. **Selection Phase**: Collector chooses THE image that resonates
4. **Minting Phase**: Selected image becomes official Wubbleton art piece
5. **Distribution Phase**: WUBBLE tokens allocated to artwork wallet

## Economic Philosophy
"The images are what creates the world" - Each selection is an act of world-building, where collectors become co-creators of the Wubbleton reality.

The exponential pricing creates a recognition reward system:
- Early recognizers pay less but receive the same WUBBLE allocation
- Later participants pay more but support a more established ecosystem
- All revenue flows back into the WUBBLE economy, creating a self-reinforcing value spiral
